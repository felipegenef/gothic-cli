	*                           Image Optimization
	*
	* This is how you optimize your SEO with lazy loading images
    * similar to what Next.js does with the Image Component.
    * To make this work we first load the same image with lower
    * resolution and after the page loads we fetch the original image
    * with the same fixed length, given the user the impression that
    * the page loaded faster. 
    * From the user's perspective the image will be blurred at first
    * then it will appear with full resolution in a smoth and almost 
    * inperceptive transition.
    *
