	*                            ðŸ“¸ OptimizedImage Component
	*
	* This component implements lazy loading with a smooth transition from a low-res placeholder
	* to the full-resolution image â€” improving perceived performance and SEO.
	*
	* How it works:
	* - When `IsFirstLoad` is `true` (from initial page render, e.g., in `Index`):
	*   - A blurred image is shown using a smaller version.
	*   - `hx-get` fetches the full-res version in the background.
	*   - On load, the image is swapped in place using HTMX.
	*
	* - When `IsFirstLoad` is `false` (in HTMX request):
	*   - The full-resolution image is rendered immediately.
	*
	* Tip: To see this in action, check how the `Index` page uses `OptimizedImage`.
