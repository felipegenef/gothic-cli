 * ðŸ’¡ Gothic Framework supports JSON-based API routes â€” similar to Next.jsâ€™s `/api` folder concept.

 * You can define lightweight REST-style endpoints using `ApiRouteConfig` and a regular Go handler function.
 * This allows you to keep backend logic co-located with your frontend code while benefiting from serverless scalability.
 *
 * This file defines a single function: `HelloWorld`, which returns a simple JSON response.

 * All logic is handled directly in the handler function (`HelloWorld`).
